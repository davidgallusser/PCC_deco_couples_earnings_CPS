### Load all years (takes some time!)
memory.limit(size=16000)
CPSall <- read.table(gzfile("cps_00004.csv.gz"), sep=",", header=TRUE)
save(CPSall, file="CPSall.rda")

# Save years into single .rda files 
for(i in  unique(CPSall$YEAR)){
  print(i)
  CPS <- CPSall[which(CPSall$YEAR==i),]
  save(CPS, file=paste0("CPS",i,".rda"))
}

### Important variables

## Weighting variables
# ASECWT      Person level CPS-ASEC weight
# ASECWTH     HH level CPS-ASEC weight
# ASECFWT     Family CPS-ASEC weight

## ID
# CPSID        HH ID
# CPSIDP       Personal ID
# SPLOC        Spouse/Partner (Person Number!)
# PERNUM       Together with YEAR , MONTH, and SERIAL, PERNUM uniquely identifies each person within IPUMS-CPS samples, though not across IPUMS-CPS samples.
# YEAR         
# MONTH
# SERIAL

# PID          #constructed person id: paste(YEAR,MONTH,SERIAL,PERNUM, sep="-") 
# SID          #constructed spouse id: paste(YEAR,MONTH,SERIAL,SPLOC, sep="-") 

## Earnings 
# CPI99        Consumer Price Index (base 1999)

# INCWAGE      wage income = OINCWAGE + if(SRCEARN==1, INCLONGJ, 0)

# SRCEARN      Source of income for the job the individual holds longest (1=wage & salary, 2=self-employment, 3=farm self-employment, 4=working without pay)
# TINCLONGJ    top code flag  (0=not top coded, 1=top coded)
